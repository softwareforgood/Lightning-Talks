# Lightning Talks

Employees are encouraged to put together [lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk). Following [Ignite's](http://igniteshow.com/) of presentation, slides auto advance every 15 seconds.

## Demo

You can view this sample project live [here](http://softwareforgood.github.io/Lightning-Talks/).

## Pre-Configured

This template includes a configuration for reveal.js already. Slides auto-advance every 15 seconds and keyboard interaction is disabled. This forces speakers to stick to a specific time constraint.

## Authoring

To setup your own lightning talk, clone down this repo, and edit the `<section>` tags inside of `<div class="slides">`.  Several sample slides are included with various types of formatting.  Each `<section>` is automatically considered its own slide.

## Reveal.js

This heavily leverages [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), and the README contains a lot of useful information.
